## Welcome, Coder ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

[Rise Nutrition](https://www.risenutrition.org) is a multi-dimensional platform that aims to optimize athlete nutrition and performance through data & analytics.

Our platform is built around the needs and experiences of athletes and sports organizations using analytics backed by our comprehensive and proprietary nutrition requirement database. The database synthesizes the latest research in sports nutrition and performance to inform the baseline for athletes by sport and position.

We are still a young company and most of our code is private, but definitely reach out to us if you are interested in any of our work. We hope to contribute back to open source as we get more comfortable with time.
