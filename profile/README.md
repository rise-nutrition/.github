## Welcome, Coder ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

[Rise Nutrition](https://www.risenutrition.org) is a multi-dimensional platform that aims to optimize athlete nutrition and performance through data & analytics.

Our platform is built around the needs and experiences of athletes and sports organizations using analytics backed by our comprehensive and proprietary nutrition requirement database. The database synthesizes the latest research in sports nutrition and performance to inform the baseline for athletes by sport and position.

We are still a young company and most of our code is private, but definitely reach out to us if you are interested in any of our work. We hope to contribute back to open source as we get more comfortable with time.

### Some Background

Rise Nutrition is a sports technology company with a social justice mission. We are a team of nutrition researchers and data scientists who understand that nourishing populations is a complex problem.

Research and data science are powerful tools that can be leveraged to address nutrition deficiencies across diverse populations, from the elite athlete to food-insecure communities. Using rigorous protocols and leveraging current technologies, our proprietary platform, Fuel to Riseâ„¢, provides usable approaches to identify nutrition deficiencies and find appropriate solutions. Our platform gives players and coaches an easy way to connect, help athletes reach their performance goals, and save time for dietitians who want to work closely with more athletes.

In the same way we optimize performance for elite athletes, our core technology is being applied to address malnutrition in food insecure communities around the world. Revenue from sales of software licenses to athletic teams funds Rise Nutritionâ€™s social justice mission - for more information about our impact projects check out Seeds to Riseâ„¢.
